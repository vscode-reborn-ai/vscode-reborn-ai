### Proxies

We've set up a proxy for anyone that needs it at `https://openai-proxy.dev/v1`. It's running [x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI](https://github.com/x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI) code on CloudFlare Workers. This is mainly for anyone who wants to use OpenAI, but cannot due to api.openai.com being blocked in your region.
