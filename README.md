# ChatGPT Reborn

ChatGPT Reborn is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to use the ChatGPT API to write, refactor, and improve your code.

## Get for VSCode

Search for "ChatGPT Reborn" in the VSCode extension search.

Or install directly:

- [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chris-hayes.chatgpt-reborn)
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/chris-hayes/chatgpt-reborn)

Or build this extension yourself (see below).

## About this fork

This is a fork of the popular, but now discontinued [vscode-chatgpt](https://github.com/gencay/vscode-chatgpt) extension. Full credit to @gencay for building the original extension and open-sourcing it. Note that this version is API-only, the browser code was not open-sourced by Gencay (due to OpenAI ToS issue).

### The new "ChatGPT: Genie AI" extension

Gencay has released a *new* extension, "ChatGPT: Genie AI", that is a continuation of his work in an API-only format: <https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode>

### What does that mean for this fork?

I will be continuing work on this extension, I have some ideas for features that focus on automation. Please understand that this means there are fairly major changes on the horizon in the name of a better dev experience. I suggest building from [gencay/vscode-gencay](https://github.com/gencay/vscode-chatgpt) source if you do not want an extension that may occasionally break as it evolves.

### FOSS

As a FOSS advocate, I feel compelled to note that Genie AI is not open-source and it sounds (to me at least) like it may at some point have paid features. I don't have a personal issue with that, it will allow the Genie AI team to spend more time improving their extension. But, you can expect "Reborn" to stay FOSS, and if you're a fan of open-source - feedback, issues, and PRs are welcome.

### GPT-4

**Required** - You must have access to GPT-4 via API. OpenAI's waitlist for GPT-4 API access is here: <https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api>

If you're part of an organization account that has GPT-4 access, be sure to set the `Organization ID`. (This will also charge the organization account). If you're wondering about the 32,000 token version of GPT-4, OpenAI hasn't made that model available yet.

## Testing the Extension in Visual Studio Code

To test the vscode-chatgpt-reborn extension in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code.

2. Press `F5` or click `Run > Start Debugging` in the menu to start a new Extension Development Host instance with the extension loaded.

3. In the Extension Development Host instance, test the extension's functionality.

4. Use the Debug Console in the main Visual Studio Code window to view any output or errors.

5. If you need to make changes to the extension, stop the Extension Development Host, make the changes, and then start the Extension Development Host again.

6. Once you are satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request to the original repository.

## TODO

## Internationalization

Initial i18n support has been added in `v3.15.0`, but I need help translating to different languages. If you're able to help at all [see this discussion](https://github.com/Christopher-Hayes/vscode-chatgpt-reborn/discussions/20).

## Proxy

This extension can be used with a proxy if you put the proxy's URL path in the "Api Base Url" config setting.

**Update 4.8.2023** - I've set up a proxy for anyone that needs it at `https://openai-proxy.dev/v1`. It's running [x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI](https://github.com/x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI) code on CloudFlare Workers.

## Tech

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - [VSCode Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- The UI is built with TailwindCSS. But, respecting VSCode's UI consistency and theme support is still a priority.
- This does not use VSCode's [WebView UI Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit/tree/main/src). But, I'm open to switching to the WebView UI toolkit since it better aligns with VSCode's UI.
