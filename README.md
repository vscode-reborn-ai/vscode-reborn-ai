## Local LLMs and Proxies

Any tool that is "compatible" with the OpenAI API should work with this extension. The tools listed below are the ones we have personally tested.

### Local LLMs tested to work with this extension

- [X] [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)
- [X] [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
- [X] [LocalAI](https://localai.io/)

### Alternative APIs tested to work with this extension

- [X] [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
- [X] [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/)

### Proxies

We've set up a proxy for anyone that needs it at `https://openai-proxy.dev/v1`. It's running [x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI](https://github.com/x-dr/chatgptProxyAPI) code on CloudFlare Workers. This is mainly for anyone who wants to use OpenAI, but cannot due to api.openai.com being blocked in your region.

### Test new features in VS Code

To test the vscode-chatgpt-reborn extension in VS Code, follow these steps:

1. Open the project directory in VS Code.

2. To start a new Extension Development Host instance with the extension loaded, press:
   1. <kbd>F5</kbd>
   2. or <kbd>Run</kbd> > <kbd>Start Debugging</kbd> in the top menu.

4. In the new VS Code window, test the extension.
